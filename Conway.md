# Why

Conway’s Law drives and constrains the productivity of firms, teams and employees.  Conway's Law is an observation taken from Melvin Conway’s paper on [How Do Committees Invent](http://www.melconway.com/research/committees.html) published in Datamation magazine in April 1968.  In the five decades since, overwhelming numbers of project leaders and entrepreneurs have confirmed Mel Conway's observation that:

Any organization that designs a system (defined more broadly here than just information systems) will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.   

Eric S. Raymond summarized this phenomenon in [The New Hacker’s Dictionary](http://www.proselex.net/documents/the%20new%20hacker's%20dictionary.pdf) by stating“If you have four groups working on a compiler, you’ll get a 4-pass compiler.”  Raymond also mention's Tom Cheatham's amendment of Conway's Law: "If a group of N persons implements a COBOL compiler, there will be N-1 passes. Someone in the group has to be the manager."
