If you don’t care, why are you contributing to open source? Surely, there must be a kernel (ha!) of care somewhere in that lovely little brain of yours.\r\n\r\n> :arrow_right: *[http://keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com)*\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n\t[sudo] gem install github_changelog_generator\r\n\r\n## Output example\r\n\r\n- Look at **[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)** for this project\r\n- [ActionSheetPicker-3.0/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/skywinder/ActionSheetPicker-3.0/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)  was generated by command:\r\n\r\n\t\tgithub_changelog_generator -u skywinder -p ActionSheetPicker-3.0\r\n\r\n- In general, it looks like this:\r\n\r\n> ## [1.2.5](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/tree/1.2.5) (2015-01-15)\r\n>\r\n> [Full Changelog](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/compare/1.2.4...1.2.5)\r\n>\r\n> **Implemented enhancements:**\r\n>\r\n> - Use milestone to specify in which version bug was fixed [\\#22](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/issues/22)\r\n>\r\n> **Fixed bugs:**\r\n>\r\n> - Error when trying to generate log for repo without tags [\\#32](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/issues/32)\r\n>\r\n> **Merged pull requests:**\r\n>\r\n> - PrettyPrint class is included using lowercase 'pp' [\\#43](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/pull/43) ([schwing](https://github.com/schwing))\r\n>\r\n> - support enterprise github via command line options [\\#42](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/pull/42) ([glenlovett](https://github.com/glenlovett))\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n**It's really simple!**\r\n\r\n- If your **`git remote`** `origin` refers to your GitHub repo, just go to your project folder and run:\r\n\r\n\t\tgithub_changelog_generator\r\n\r\n-  Or, run this from anywhere:\r\n    - `github_changelog_generator -u github_username -p github_project`\r\n    - `github_changelog_generator  github_username/github_project`\r\n\r\nThis generates a changelog to the `CHANGELOG.md` file, with pretty markdown formatting.\r\n\r\n### Params\r\nType `github_changelog_generator --help` for details.\r\n\r\nFor more details about params, read the Wiki page: [**Advanced change log generation examples**](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator/wiki/Advanced-change-log-generation-examples)\r\n\r\n### Params File\r\nIn your project root, you can put a params file named `.github_changelog_generator` to override default params:\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nunreleased=false\r\nfuture-release=5.0.0\r\nsince-tag=1.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### GitHub token\r\n\r\nGitHub only allows only 50 unauthenticated requests per hour. \r\nTherefore, it's recommended to run this script with authentication by using a **token**.\r\n\r\nHere's how:\r\n\r\n- [Generate a token here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=GitHub%20Changelog%20Generator%20token)\r\n- Either:\r\n    - Run the script with `--token <your-40-digit-token>`; **OR**\r\n    - Set the `CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to your 40 digit token\r\n\r\nYou can set an environment variable by running the following command at the prompt, or by adding it to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`):\r\n\r\n        export CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN=\"«your-40-digit-github-token»\"\r\n\r\nSo, if you got an error like this:\r\n>! /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/github_api-0.12.2/lib/github_api/response/raise_error.rb:14:in `on_complete'\r\n\r\nIt's time to create this token! (Or, wait an hour for GitHub to reset your unauthenticated request limit.)\r\n\r\n## Migrating from a manual changelog\r\n\r\nKnowing how dedicated you are to your project, you probably haven't been waiting for `github-changelog-generator` to keep a changelog.\r\nBut you probably don't want your project's open issues and PRs for all past features listed in your historic changelog, either.\r\n\r\nThat's where `--base <your-manual-changelog.md>` comes in handy!\r\nThis option lets append your old manual changelog to the end of the generated entries.\r\n\r\nIf you have a `HISTORY.md` file in your project, it will automatically be picked as the static historical changelog and appended.\r\n\r\n### Rake task\r\n\r\nYou love `rake`? We do, too! So, we've made it even easier for you: \r\nwe've provided a `rake` task library for your changelog generation.\r\n\r\nJust put something like this in your `Rakefile`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nGitHubChangelogGenerator::RakeTask.new :changelog do |config|\r\n  config.since_tag = '0.1.14'\r\n  config.future_release = '0.2.0'\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll command line options can be passed to the `rake` task as `config` parameters. And since you're naming the `rake` task yourself, you can create as many as you want.\r\n\r\n## Features and advantages of this project\r\n- Generate canonical, neat change log file, followed by [basic change log guidelines](http://keepachangelog.com) :gem:\r\n- Optionally generate **Unreleased** changes (closed issues that have not released yet) :dizzy:\r\n- **GitHub Enterprise support** via command line options! :factory:\r\n- Flexible format **customization**:\r\n    - **Customize** issues that **should be added** to changelog :eight_spoked_asterisk:\r\n    - **Custom date formats** supported (but keep [ISO 8601](http://xkcd.com/1179/) in mind!) :date:\r\n    - Manually specify the version that fixed an issue (for cases when the issue's Closed date doesn't match) by giving the issue's `milestone` the same name as the tag of version :pushpin:\r\n    - Automatically **exclude specific issues** that are irrelevant to your changelog (by default, any issue labeled `question`, `duplicate`, `invalid`, or `wontfix`) :scissors:\r\n- **Distinguish** issues **by labels**. :mag_right:\r\n    - Merged pull requests (all merged pull-requests) :twisted_rightwards_arrows:\r\n    - Bug fixes (issues labeled `bug`) :beetle:\r\n    - Enhancements (issues labeled `enhancement`) :star2:\r\n    - Issues (closed issues with no labels) :non-potable_water:\r\n\r\n- Manually include or exclude issues by labels :wrench:\r\n- Customize lots more! Tweak the changelog to fit your preferences :tophat:\r\n(*See `github_changelog_generator --help`  for details)*\r\n\r\n\r\n###Alternatives\r\nHere is a [wikipage list of alternatives](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/wiki/Alternatives) that I found. But none satisfied my requirements.\r\n\r\n*If you know other projects, feel free to edit this Wiki page!*\r\n\r\n\r\n### Projects using this library\r\nHere's a [wikipage list of projects](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/wiki/Projects-using-Github-Changelog-Generator).\r\n\r\nIf you've used this project in a live app, please let me know! Nothing makes me happier than seeing someone else take my work and go wild with it.\r\n\r\n*If you are using `github_changelog_generator` to generate your project's changelog, or know of other projects using it, please [add it to this list] (https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/wiki/Projects-using-Github-Changelog-Generator).*\r\n\r\n## Am I missing some essential feature?\r\n\r\n- **Nothing is impossible!**\r\n\r\n- Open an [issue](https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/issues/new) and let's make the generator better together!\r\n\r\n- *Bug reports, feature requests, patches, and well-wishes are always welcome.* :heavy_exclamation_mark:\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n- ***I already use GitHub Releases. Why do I need this?***\r\n\r\nGitHub Releases is a very good thing. And it's very good practice to maintain it. (Not a lot of people are using it yet!) :congratulations:\r\n\r\n*BTW: I would like to support GitHub Releases in [next releases](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator/issues/56) ;)*\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to compare the quality of handwritten and auto-generated logs. That said....\r\n\r\nAn auto-generated changelog really helps, even if you manually fill in the release notes!\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nWhen I found a closed bug, it's very useful know which release fixed it. \r\nIn this case, you can easily find the issue by \\# in `CHANGELOG.md`.\r\n\r\n- it's not quite as easy to find this in handwritten releases notes\r\n- a generated file saves you the trouble of remembering everything;\r\n  sometimes people forget to add things to a handwritten file\r\n\r\nUltimately, I think GitHub Releases is ideal for end-users. \r\nMeanwhile, `CHANGELOG.md` lives right in the repository, with its detailed list of changes, which is handy for developers.\r\nFinally, there's nothing wrong with using GitHub Releases alongside `CHANGELOG.md` in this combination.\r\n\r\n- ***I received a warning: \"GitHub API rate limit exceed\"  What does this mean?***\r\n\r\nGitHub [limits the number of API requests](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting) you can make in an hour. You can make up to 5,000 requests per hour. For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit is only up to 60 requests per hour. Unauthenticated requests are associated with your IP address (not the user making requests).\r\n\r\nIf you're seeing this warning, please do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you're providing an OAuth token, so you're not making requests anonymously. Using an OAuth token increases your hourly request maximum from 60 to 5000.\r\n2. If you have a large repo with lots of issues/PRs, you can use `--max-issues NUM` to limit the number of issues that are pulled back. For example: `--max-issues 1000`\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Create an issue and describe your idea\r\n2. [Fork it] (https://github.com/skywinder/Github-Changelog-Generator/fork)\r\n3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n5. Publish the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n6. Create a new Pull Request\r\n7. Profit! :white_check_mark:\r\n\r\n*To test your workflow with changelog generator, you can use [test repo](https://github.com/skywinder/changelog_test/)*\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nGithub Changelog Generator is released under the [Apache License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/Apache).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
